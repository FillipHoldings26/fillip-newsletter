        latamAngle: 'This week\'s clearest LatAm signal comes from the Seattle Seahawks\' record $9.612 billion sale, where Gonzalo Hevia Baillères and the Aramburuzabala family joined the ownership group as co-owners — not as sponsors or spectators, but as equity holders in the NFL\'s most expensive franchise transaction ever. It\'s a rare instance of Mexican private capital taking a direct stake inside a major U.S. sports league\'s ownership structure, at the same moment record valuations are resetting across American sports, as with Kroenke\'s $4 billion Angels purchase this same week.

            emailSummary: '<strong>\'Backrooms\'</strong>, directed by <strong>Kane Parsons</strong> (age 20), opened with <strong>$81 million</strong> from <strong>3,442 theaters</strong> — setting <strong>A24\'s all-time opening weekend record</strong> — against a production budget of approximately <strong>$10 million</strong>. The film earned <strong>$118 million globally</strong> in its opening frame. <strong>85% of the audience was under 35</strong>; over <strong>50% were 25 or younger</strong>. Parsons became the <strong>youngest filmmaker ever to have a #1 box office film</strong>. Disney\'s <strong>\'The Mandalorian and Grogu\'</strong> dropped <strong>70%</strong> in its second weekend.',
            whyItMatters: 'A $10M budget delivering $81M domestic and $118M global in opening weekend — alongside \'Obsession\' ($1M budget, $106M domestic) — signals that creator-economy directors with built-in digital audiences are repricing Hollywood\'s production cost assumptions.',
